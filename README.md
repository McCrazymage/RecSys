# RecSys

The RecSys library implements different RecSys algorithms described in research papers including mine. The library is written in C# for the .NET platform (https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet), and runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS X.

Implemented Algorithms
----------------------
  - **Matrix Factorization** [[1]](#1): 
    - the standard and popular matrix factorization approach to collaborative filtering.
  - **UserKNN** [[2]](#2): 
    - the standard and popular K-Nearest Neighbors approach to collaborative filtering.
  - **PrefUserKNN** [[3]](#3):
    - UserKNN plus accepting *preference relations* as input to perofrm top-N recommendation.
  - **PrefNMF Matrix Factorization** [[4]](#4):
    - Matrix Factorization plus accepting *preference relations* as input to perofrm top-N recommendation.
  - **Ordinal Random Fields** [[5]](#5):
    - a combination of Markov Random Fields and Ordinal Matrix Factorization techniques.
    - exploits both *Global* and *Local* structures in the rating matrix.
    - exploits *ordinal properties* of ratings.
  - **Preference Random Fields** [[6]](#6):
    - exploits both *Global* and *Local* structures in the rating matrix.
    - takes *preference relations* as input to perofrm top-N recommendation.
